# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. 

    ```
    My sample is: All employees in entry and lower level roles at a specific location(province) of the compant who are currently in their notice period.

    This sample is designed to capture the perspectives of employees who are leaving the company to obtain insights into the reasons behind turnover. 
    **Positives** : 1. I can get direct insights into turnover reasons by answering the question : Why does the employee choose to resign ?

                2. I focus on the key group to study it as most employees who chose to resign are from entry and lower level roles. They contribute directly to the turnover rate.

    **Limitations** : 1. Bias in responses : Employees who are in the notice period may have more negative opinions about the company that can result in a bias. If I could include a random sample of current employees to understand their perspective on why they stick to this company may help to get a balanced result. In my survey questionaire, except question 6, all can be utilized to get opinion of current employees. I have to reframe Q6 to survey both the groups. 

                    2. Non-response bias: Not all employees may choose to participate in the survey, especially those who are altready in their notice period. They might be ;ess engaged or might not represent the views honestly in the survey.

                    3. Limited geographical scope : The sampling frame is restricted to a specific location/province. So, the result might not fully representative of the company as a whole. The turnover trends could vary by location, so it wouldnt represent all the employees of the company in other locations. The turnover rate might be higher in certain branches or departments compare to others, so the result might not capture the full picture across the company. 

    Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

    No, the sample is not fully representative of the entire target population. While it provides valuable insight into why employees who are leaving are making that decision, it excludes the perspectives of current employees which is a significant drawback.

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

    ```Yes, I wish to make changes in the original survey. I want to rephrase Q6 so that this questionaire can be shared with current employees and leaving employees to ensure that I get insights on both sides - those who decided to stay and those who decided to leave. 

   UPDATED **ORIGINAL SURVEY QUESTIONAIRE ** Change made : REPHRASED Q6..As mentioned previously, I rephrase Q6 so that I can capture the perspectives of current employees and leaving employees to draw a better and balanced conclusion.

10. Does your role align with your skill set? 
    a. Yes  b.No  c.Maybe
    


3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?


  No, an observational study would not be sufficient to understand the full scope of the reasons behind employee turnover in this context. 1. Lack of open communication : The employees might not be comfortable in opening up their difficulties or dissatisfaction, due to concerns over retaliation or fear of judgement. A survey allows for anonymity whcih gives employees the freedom to be honest without any fear.
  2. THe emotional and psychological factors cannot be studied and will be missed.
